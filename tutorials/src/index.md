# fck Tutorials

Welcome to the learnering area. This section is pretty heavily under development due to the current nature of fck, but most things should be pretty reliable to give you an idea of how it should work. The tutorials are split into different sections that all focus on one aspect of fck. Enjoy!

All of these tutorials are written in markdown and converted into html. If you would prefer a markdown version, [GitHub](https://github.com/fck-language/fck-language.github.io/tree/main/tutorials/src) is the place to be.

### A basic introduction
- [Hello World!](hello_world.md)

### The multilingual aspect
- [How does it work?](how_lang_work.md)
